/* invisible vs .invisible
 *
 * uses .invisible where the rest of Moodle uses .dimmed
 * fixible in block renderer?
 *
 * There's seems to be even more naming confusion here since,
 * blocks can be actually 'visible' (or not) to students,
 * marked 'visible' but really just dimmed to indicate to editors
 * that students can't see them or  'visible' to the user who 
 * collapses them, 'visible' if you have the right role and in 
 * different circumstances different sections of a block can
 * be 'visible' or not.

 currently worked around in renderers.php function block{}
 by rewriting the class name "invisible" to "dimmed",
 though the blocks don't look particularly different apart
 from their contents disappearing.
 
 dimming all the edit icons apart from unhide, might be a 
 nice effect, though they'd still be active. Maybe reverse
 it to white?

  visibility: visible;
