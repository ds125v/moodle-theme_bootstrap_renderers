moodle-theme_bootstrap_renderers
================================

A developer theme for working on Moodle renderers that output Bootstrap compatible HTML

TODO
----

* file an enhancement request about classes in Moodle that clash with Bootstrap (e.g. .label, .controls, .content, .row)
* fix the above in core code
* go through every renderer.php in Moodle (starting with outputrenderers.php) and rewrite to match Bootstrap expectations
* figure out how to switch of CSS coming from modules
